GUI format:
We will take this ready-made free template and add the option to connect to the user (top side) and we will match the design and content to the pizzeria.
The main page will look more or less like the page in the free template, after connecting to the user the user will be transferred to the page that suits him (manager / employee / customer) and everyone will have the options that are open to him and tailored to him.
Customer page - will look like the main page with the pizzeria menu, product basket, order construction, payment.
Employee page - a page that views incoming orders and their operation, customer details.
Manager page - looks more or less like the employee but has other options such as managing an order, discounting a discount, etc., and also an option to download / add dishes to the menu.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105584000/170514032-25786a90-9d99-4b4e-8926-d1abc102249c.png)
